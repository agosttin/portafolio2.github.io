      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I am a young individual with a deep passion for technology and web development, at the age of 20, and an unwavering determination to achieve my goals. <br><br>
        My journey in web development began during my teenage years when I started learning programming languages on my own. As I honed my skills, I not only discovered a passion but also the ability to create innovative solutions through code. <br> <br>
        Currently, I am enrolled in the 'JÃ³venes a Programar' program, where I'm gaining valuable insights into the world of software development. In the near future, I plan to pursue a degree in Information Technology Analysis; however, I'm actively seeking opportunities to fund my studies. My passion for technology drives me to continuously learn and improve, motivating me to actively participate in various academic and collaborative projects. <br><br>
        I strongly believe in the power of collaboration and community. I have actively contributed to open-source projects and worked in multidisciplinary teams to create innovative web applications. My experience in previous projects has taught me the importance of effective communication, problem-solving, and teamwork. <br><br>
        In addition to my commitment to web development, I have a passion for user interface design and user experience. I believe that the combination of strong technical skills and meticulous attention to detail is essential for creating exceptional web experiences. <br> <br>
        In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and staying updated on the latest trends in web development. I am also an outdoor enthusiast, and whenever I can, I escape from the screen to enjoy the natural beauty of Uruguay. <br><br>
        I am excited about the opportunities that the world of web development has to offer, and I am eager to continue growing and contributing to the field. My goal is to further enhance my skills and develop web solutions that positively impact people's lives.
